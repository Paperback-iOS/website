## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/website/issues?q=label%3Aquestion) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open a Question [Issue](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/website/issues/new?template=question).
- Fill in the template and make sure to provide all relevant information.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

You may always contact us through our [official Discord server](https://discord.paperback.moe) as well.

## Reporting Bugs

### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using an incompatible browser.
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/website/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Browser where you found it in and its version
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue?

### Submitting a Good Bug Report

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead use the GitHub [Security Advisory tab](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/website/security/advisories) for sensitive bugs.

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/website/issues) to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open a Bug [Issue](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/website/issues/new?template=bug).
- Fill in the template and provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it is filed:

- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps. Bugs without reproduction steps will not be addressed until they can be reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue it will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

## Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for the website, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

### Before Submitting an Enhancement suggestion

- Find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/website/issues?q=label%3Aenhancement) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this enhancement. Keep in mind that we want enhancements that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset.

### Submiting a Good Enhancement Suggestion

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/website/issues).

- Open an Enhancement [Issue](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/website/issues/new?template=enhancement).
- Fill in the template and make sure to provide all relevant information.

Once it is filed:

- A team member will review your enhancement suggestion and discuss its feasibility and impact on the project.
- If the enhancement is deemed appropriate and aligns with the project's goals, it will be labeled accordingly and left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).
