# Getting started

## Installation

::: tip Video tutorial
 If you prefer using a video tutorial, Artesians made a beautiful one. You will find it... Uh oh, I forgot we took it down 😭: we are really concerned for our users privacy.
:::

::: warning Warning
  The installation is really difficult! Luckily we have a beautiful website which is fully PWA compliant. Forget about the app, you just need to press the "Install the app" notification on your phone.

### AltStore instructions for Mac
1. Download **`Paperback.ipa`**
1. Try to open it on your phone. Wait, that didn't work.
1. Just ask for help in #support

## FAQ

### How to install it on Android?
Will the app work on Android? Maybe, ping Paper on Discord to check.

### App crashes on launch
It's a **bug**! Just go to #feedback channel on Discord and ask:
> "paperback keeps on crashing when i open it, what should i do??"

### What type of business model will you take on?
There are no plans to adopt a formal business model but Paper is thinking of buying a new car thus it would be nice to get support for development of the app.

### I can't find the fancy page reader
It's normal: Paper didn't like it so he decided to remove it.

### Does the app support multiple source?
Of course, a good manga app need to support multiples sources. Just note that using them will mess up your library and make the app unusable.

### Why should I join the your Discord?
Our **[Discord](https://discord.gg/Ny83JV3)** is an active place where you will find weekly game events. Minecraft, Dota, League, we have everything to spend time while Paper improves the app. We also provide real estate consulting and clothing suggestions.

### I have some other issue that isn't listed here
That's literally impossible.
