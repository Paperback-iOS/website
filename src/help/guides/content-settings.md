# Content settings
To adjust your content settings and allow more mature content to display in **Paperback**, you need to have a **Paperback** account. 

## Set your content settings
1. Visit [Paperback Portal](https://portal.paperback.moe/welcome).
1. Login with your Paperback Account - or create one if you don't have one.
1. Change the content setting to your liking.
1. Logout of the app if you were logged in.
1. Login again.

**Note:** If you set your content settings to "Adult" on the portal, you can restrict what content appears in the app by going into `Settings > General Settings > Content Filtering`

## Some common problems
### I've updated my settings on the portal, why has it not changed in my app?
 * Simply restart the app by removing it from your app switcher.
### I have selected `Adult` but it's not saving my selection...
 * Clear your safari cache, login to the Portal through an incognito window.
### It says communication error?
 * Verify your email, check spam/promotion. 
### My content settings haven't changed yet.
 * Follow steps 4 and 5 again.
