# Troubleshooting

If you're having problems with the application, please check here before posting. If you're having an issue that is not listed here, please use the #support channel on **[Discord](https://discord.gg/Ny83JV3)** to ask questions.

--- 

### App crashes on launch
**Public build** users should check if they're on iOS 13.4+.
**Beta/Patron build** users should ping Paper on the Discord in the #supporter-chat channel.

---

### App crashes when trying to follow on iPad
This is a known Apple bug that is fixed in iPadOS 13.4, Update to iOS 13.4 or avoid following manga from Paperback and use MangaDex's website to follow (and then sync).

---

### How do I filter languages
Go to Settings > Content Settings.

---

### How do I enable Hentai
Go to [https://mangadex.org/settings](https://mangadex.org/settings) and login. Look for "**Hentai Toggle**" and enable it.
Then restart the app and go to Settings > Content Settings.

---

### My content settings are reset everytime I open the app
You need to login with "**Remember Me**" checked.
Also make sure that your email is verified.

---

### The reader is open but stays blank when I try to read a chapter
 * Switch between the horizontal/vertical viewers. If switching doesn't fix, try to read the same chapter on safari, if it works, ping @Paper on Discord in #support channel.
 * Some chapters are taken off of MangaDex due to group conflicts or chapters being scans of the official TL.

---

### A blue X appears sometimes when I try to read a chapter
Scroll/swipe a couple of pages away then come back to the failed page, it should reload. If that doesn't work, close the reader and open the chapter the again.

---

### Pages often fail/take a long time to load
 * If you're in SEA get a VPN (Psiphon or ProtonVPN) MangaDex servers have routing issues in SEA.


 * If you're not in SEA and still face this issue, see if there's any announcements in the MangaDex discord about server complications.

---

### I can't find X manga but it's on MangaDex
 * If the manga is REALLY new (1st chapter added in the last hour) it wont be available until after an hour.
 * If the manga isn't new, chances are it's restricted. At the moment, the app doesn't support reading restricted Manga.
Read on the website instead.

---

### Syncing lists takes a really long time
Syncing more than 1,000 manga will take some time, however you can improve this improve by changing the list type on Follows page of MD:
 * On Safari, go to [https://mangadex.org/follows/manga/](https://mangadex.org/follows/manga/) and change the display list to "Simple List" from the menu in the top right of the table.

### Sorting by Latest Updates doesn't work
It works but it doesn't respect user's selected language, try to use Update Count sorting instead.

### I have an issue that's not listed here
If its a bug, file a bug report on GitHub for review. Otherwise, ask for help in the Discord #support channel.
