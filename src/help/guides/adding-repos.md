# External Source Repositories
## What is an External Repository?

**Paperback** out of the box only comes with **SafeDex** as a source for manga. The app however has support for adding sources from external repositories which are not on the official listings. Beta Sources, 18+ Sources, and sources developed independently are separated due to **Paperback** having to adhere to Apple policies in order to be distributed through TestFlight and the Apple App Store. 

## Adding an External Repository
1. Visit [Known Repositories](/help/guides/adding-repos/#known-repositories) on your Device's web browser.
1. Add a Source Repository by tapping "**Add to Paperback**".

## Installing a Source from a repository
1. Follow [Adding an External Repository](/help/guides/adding-repos/#adding-an-external-repository) to add a source repository to Paperback.
1. Navigate to the **Settings** tab then tap **Sources** menu item.
1. Tap on the previously added repository under the "Repositories" section.
1. Choose a source to install.
