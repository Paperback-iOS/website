# External Source Repositories
## What is an External Repository?
**Paperback** out of the box only comes with **MangaDex** as a source for manga. The app however has support for adding sources from external repositories which are not on the official listings. Beta Sources, 18+ Sources, and sources developed independently are separated due to **Paperback** having to adhere to Apple policies in order to be distributed through TestFlight and the Apple App Store. 


## Adding an External Repository
1. Open up Paperback on your device
1. Navigate to the **Settings** tab of the application
1. Navigate to the **Sources** tab inside of Settings
1. At the bottom of the page, you are able to add a repository by specifying a name, and the URL which the repository sits at. Ensure that your repository title is at least 4 characters long
    > Reference the [Known Repositories](/help/guides/adding-repos/#known-repositories) section for a list of known repositories, their links, and what they contain
1. Tap "**Add**"
1. Select the repository that you have added, which should have appeared in the list of repositories on this page
    > If you do not see sources, you may have typed in your Base URL incorrectly. Delete the repository and try again. If you do see sources, congratulations!
