# External Source Repositories
## What is an External Repository?
**Paperback** out of the box only comes with **MangaDex** as a source for manga. The app however has support for adding manga from external repositories which are not on the official listings. Beta Sources, 18+ Sources, and sources developed independently are seperated due to **Paperback** having to adhere to Apple policies in order to be distributed through TestFlight and the Apple App Store. 

::: warning Warning
Currently external sources are only available on the Beta version of the application. If you are not a Patreon, this guide will not be very useful to you. This feature will be available in public builds in the future.
