## Installation FAQ
### I get "The beta is full" when trying to install the app
There can only be a limited number of testers on TestFlight due to the 10k testers limit enforced by Apple.
To install the app you can use an other method of installation like [AltStore sideloading](/help/installation/public-altstore/).
