# Source development quickstart

## Preparing the development environment

1. Create your own fork of one of our repositories, like [Extensions Promises](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/extensions-main-promises).

1. Create a new branch before working on your new fork. The method of branching depends on the Git CLI/GUI that you use, reference your software manual, or contact us if you need help with this step.

1. Clone the fork you've just created on your computer.

1. Install dependencies by running
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

You are ready to start developing a source. When you think the source should be available for users, submit a pull request to one of our repository.

::: aside
If you need help figuring to which repository you should submit your new pull request, don't hesitate to contact us.
