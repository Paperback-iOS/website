# Contributing to Paperback

::: info Contributing to Paperback
Welcome to the Paperback contributing guide. While the Paperback app itself is a closed source application, it involves a pretty important open source ecosystem. Everyone is welcome to contribute and help in our various projects!

## Paperback Ecosystem

You will find all of our projects in our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS). Additionally, discussions usually take place in our [official Discord server](https://discord.paperback.moe). You're more than welcome to join in on the conversation!

Here are some of our main projects:

### Paperback extension

The official Paperback extension is used for connecting the Paperback app with your own Komga instance ([Learn more](/getting-started/adding-content/komga)). Learn how to develop your own extensions and contribute to existing ones with our [extension development guide](/contributing/extension-development/).

### Paperback website

Any assistance in improving this website is greatly appreciated. Begin with our [website development guide](/contributing/extension-development/).

### Paperback Toolchain and Types

Our command-line interface (CLI) tool for testing and building extensions, along with the types required for the Paperback API. You can access the source code in our GitHub organization's [`paperback-toolchain` repository](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/paperback-toolchain).
