# Migrate to v0.8

## Using `npx paperback migrate`

```bash
npx paperback migrate
```

This will automatically upgrade most 0.7 functions to their respective 0.8 ones.

::: warning
Do note that this does **NOT** work for source settings.
The migration isn't 100%, so you might need to update and fix some imports/function, should be fine for 70%.

## Manually

Please refer to the [0.8 docs](/contributing/extensions/reference-0.8/).
