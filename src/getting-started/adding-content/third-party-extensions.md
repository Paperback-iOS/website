# Third-Party Extensions

Paperback provides a way to add additional content to the app using third-party extensions. These extensions are not developed or maintained by the Paperback developers. Therefore, we do not provide any info regarding those extensions.

Neither do we permit discussions (including support) related them on the official Discord server or GitHub page. Instead, we recommend that you contact the extension developer for support.
