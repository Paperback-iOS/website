# Komga

Komga serves as a media server for comics, manga, BDs, magazines, and eBooks. It offers the capability to organize and manage CBZ, CBR, PDF, and EPUB files (Note: EPUBs are currently not supported by Paperback) across different libraries, collections, or reading lists.

Check their [official website](https://komga.org) for more info.

::: warning Komga Requires a Computer
Utilizing Komga with Paperback necessitates having a computer running Komga at all times when accessing Paperback. Additionally, digital versions of your content must be available on this computer.

If this method doesn't suit your needs, we suggest exploring the [third-party extensions](/getting-started/adding-content/third-party-extensions) option.
