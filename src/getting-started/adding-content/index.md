# Adding Content

The Paperback app does not include any preloaded content. Users are required to add their own content. This process is straightforward and typically takes less than 10 minutes when following the appropriate steps.

There are two primary methods for adding content to the app:

## Komga

Komga is a media server designed for comics, manga, BDs, magazines, and eBooks.

## Third-Party Extensions

You can also utilize other third-party extensions which don't require your own media server.
