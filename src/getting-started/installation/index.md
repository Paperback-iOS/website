# Installation

There are three methods to install Paperback:

-   **App Store:** The App Store provides the stable release, making it the simplest and most commonly used installation method.
-   **TestFlight:** TestFlight hosts the alpha and beta builds of the app, exclusively accessible to Patreon supporters.
-   **Sideloading:** Towards the end of a development cycle, the `.ipa` file becomes available for sideloading the app.

More info on these methods can be found in the tabs bellow.

== App Store

Look for ["Paperback - A Komga Client"](https://apps.apple.com/app/paperback-a-komga-client/id1626613373) on the App Store. Paperback is accessible in the majority of countries. You can view the complete list of available regions [here](/getting-started/installation/availability).

::: tip App Store Availability
You can always change your App Store region to one where the app is available if it is not accessible in your current region. However, we recommend switching back to your original region afterward. You can find a guide on how to do this [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201389).

    Ensure your Discord username contains only alphanumeric characters, as using special characters in your will not work.

== Sideloading

Sideloading serves as an alternative method for app installation, involving the use of a sideloading tool on a computer such as [Alt Store](https://altstore.io) or [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io) to load an `.ipa` file onto your Apple device. You can find the latest released `.ipa` file [here](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/app/releases/latest).

However, we advise against this method due to its complexity and the limitations associated with sideloading. Instead, we recommend utilizing either the App Store or TestFlight installation methods for a smoother experience.
