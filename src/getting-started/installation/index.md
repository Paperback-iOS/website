# Installation

There are three methods to install Paperback:

- **App Store:** The App Store provides the stable release, making it the simplest and most commonly used installation method.
- **TestFlight:** TestFlight hosts the alpha and beta builds of the app, exclusively accessible to Patreon supporters and Discord server boosters.
- **Sideloading:** There also always is an `.ipa` file of the stable release for those who prefer sideloading the app.

More info on these methods can be found in the tabs bellow.

::: info Device Support

== App Store

Look for ["Paperback - A Komga Client"](https://apps.apple.com/app/paperback-a-komga-client/id1626613373) on the App Store. Paperback is accessible in the majority of countries. You can view the complete list of available regions [here](/getting-started/installation/availability).

::: tip App Store Availability
You can always change your App Store region to one where the app is available if it is not accessible in your current region. However, we recommend switching back to your original region afterwards. You can find a guide on how to do this [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201389).

== TestFlight

::: warning Patron and Discord Booster Exclusive
Access to beta and alpha builds of Paperback requires being a [Patreon supporter](https://patreon.com/FaizanDurrani) or a [Discord server booster](https://discord.paperback.moe). While all Patreon supporters and Discord server boosters gain access to beta builds, alpha builds are exclusive to the Patreon supporter++ tier supporters.

Additionally, supporters/boosters will gain access to the `#beta-chat` channel in the official Discord server. Patreon `supporter++` tier supporters get access to the `#alpha` channel as well.

3. Patreon supporters will need to link their Discord account in their [Patreon settings](https://www.patreon.com/settings/apps).

   > This process will prompt you for your email and the build you wish to access (beta or alpha). Your email remains private and is not visible to other Discord users ([Learn more](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500000580222-Ephemeral-Messages-FAQ)).

Expect to receive a TestFlight invite via email within a few minutes after executing the command.

3. Paperback will now appear in the TestFlight app, allowing you to install it in the same manner as you would with an app from the App Store.

::: details Frequently Asked Questions

- **Why am I limited to one invite per 6 hours?**

  This is done to not overload the bot. You must wait for the cooldown period to end to request a new invite.

- **What should I do if I made a typo or provided the wrong email when requesting an invite?**

  If a mistake is made, you must wait 6 hours to request a new invite.

- **Why did the `/invite` command fail?**

  Ensure your Discord username contains only alphanumeric characters, as using special characters in it will not work.

- **Why am I unable to type in the `#beta-chat` or `#alpha` channels?**

  This indicates that you haven't acquired the supporter role yet. Refer to the instructions and ensure that you are on a valid tier, as custom pledges don't grant the Supporter role.

- **What should I do if I haven't received an invite after completing all steps?**

  If you've completed all steps but haven't received an invite, create a new post in the `#support` channel of the official Discord server, info on how to do this can be found [here](/getting-started/further-support/).

== Sideloading

Sideloading serves as an alternative method for app installation, involving the use of a sideloading tool on a computer such as [Alt Store](https://altstore.io) or [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io) to load an `.ipa` file onto your Apple device. You can find the latest released `.ipa` file [here](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/app/releases/latest).

However, we advise against this method due to its complexity and the limitations associated with sideloading. Instead, we recommend utilizing either the App Store or TestFlight installation methods for a smoother experience.
