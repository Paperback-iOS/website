== Sideloading

Sideloading is an alternative method to install apps, this is done using a sideloading tool on a computer like [Alt Store](https://altstore.io) or [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io) to load an `.ipa` file onto your Apple device. You can find the latest released `.ipa` file [here](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/app/releases/latest).

We advice against this method because of the complexity and the limitations of sideloading. Instead we recommend that you either use the App Store or TestFlight installation methods.
