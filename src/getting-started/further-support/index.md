# Further Support

Additional support can be received in various ways if the guides on this website don't address your needs. However, we recommend checking our FAQ section before exploring other options.

## Checking Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Our FAQ section is regularly updated to cover anything from basic questions about this project to advanced troubleshooting queries related to app usage.

[Go to FAQ](/faq/)

## Using the Official Discord Server

You're always welcome to join our official Discord server, which boasts an active community and an easily accessible support section.

::: tip Discord Versus GitHub
While Discord might be your preferred platform for questions, we recommend using our GitHub page ([Learn more](#using-the-github-repository)) for reporting bugs or making enhancement suggestions. It provides convenient issue templates.
:::

### Joining

You can join using [this link](https://discord.paperback.moe) (a Discord account is required but easy to set up). When you join, please go through the onboarding process and review and accept all the rules.

::: danger Breaking the Rules
Breaking these rules can result in a time-out or permanent ban!
:::

### Checking Help-Desk

The `#help-desk` is a self-help channel that provides links to guides or links to FAQ items on our website. We recommend checking this channel before seeking further assistance in `#support`.

### Getting Support

::: warning Support Warning

- **Support Questions Belong in the Support Section:**
  Please post your support questions in the `#support` channel, not in a channel in the community section. Repeatedly asking for support in a channel in the community section may result in a time-out action.

- **No Support Provided for Third-Party Extensions:**
  Ensure your question is not related to third-party extensions, as we do not maintain those and cannot offer assistance ([Learn more](/getting-started/adding-content/third-party-extensions))!

:::

Once you've accepted the rules, you can post in the `#support` channel. Here's what we ask you to do:

1. Check the `#support` channel for similar questions. Join the conversation if your issue is already being discussed.
2. If your question isn't in `#support`, create a post with a descriptive title and detailed description, including your OS and app version, and potentially extension version ([Learn more](/getting-started/further-support/version-numbers)).

   ::: tip Don't Share Sensitive Information
   Never share sensitive information in a support post. If a Paperback team member requires it, they will ask you to send a [ModMail](#making-a-modmail).
   :::

3. A community or staff member will respond to your post as soon as possible (please note that everyone helping is a volunteer).
4. You might be directed to our GitHub page to post your issue in the case of a bug or an enhancement suggestion.

### Giving Feedback

Use the `#feedback` channel to provide non-urgent feedback on the app, including non-app-breaking bugs and enhancement suggestions. Follow the same structure as for support posts.

## Using the GitHub Repository

GitHub is a platform for developers to store and share code. It also allows people to report bugs with the app and make enhancement suggestions using Issues. You can find our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/app).

### Making an Issue

You can make an issue by going to the Issues tab and pressing the green "New issue" button or by clicking on [this link](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/app/issues/new/choose).

You'll be able to choose from multiple templates to help you create a helpful issue.

::: tip Don't Share Sensitive Information
Never share sensitive information on GitHub. If a Paperback team member requires it, they will ask you to send a [ModMail](#making-a-modmail).
:::

## Making a ModMail

Use a modmail when you need support regarding a matter containing sensitive information.

Send a DM with your question to the [@Support & Modmail](https://discord.com/users/903660777599275030) bot, which you can find in the official Discord server.
