# Changing Content Settings

Content in your app may be filtered based on your content settings. Because of this adjusting your content settings might be necessary. Here is how to do it:

1. Visit the [Paperback Portal](https://portal.paperback.moe).
2. Log in with your Paperback Account or create one if you don't have one.
   > New accounts need to have their email address verified, an email for this will be send out automatically on account creation (check your spam/promotion folders).
3. Customize the content setting to your preference. Available options are "Restricted", "Mature" and "Adult".
4. If you were logged in, log out of the app.
5. Log back in again.

::: tip Notes

- If you set your content settings to "Adult" on the portal, you can control what content appears in the app by navigating to **Settings** > **General** > **Content Filtering**.
- Setting your content settings to anything lower than "Adult" will prevent you from installing extensions from repositories containing at least one "Adult" extension. The same applies to "Mature".

::: details Frequently Asked Questions

- **Why hasn't my settings update on the portal reflected in my app?**

  Simply log out, restart the app by removing it from your app switcher, and log back in.

- **Why isn't my selection of "Adult" saving?**

  Clear your browser cache or log in to the Portal through an incognito window and try again.

- **Why am I encountering a communication/unknown error or a crash when logging in to the app?**

  Ensure your email is verified (check your spam/promotion folders). If the issue persists, make a support post in the official Discord server. You can find a guide on how to do that [here](/getting-started/further-support/#using-the-official-discord-server).

- **Why is this necessary?**

  Apple requires this for apps that may display incidental mature “NSFW” content ([Learn more](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#user-generated-content)).
