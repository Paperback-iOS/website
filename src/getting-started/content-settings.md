# Changing Content Settings

Adjusting your content settings to "Mature" or "Adult" tends to be necessary to be able to add content to your app. Here is how to do this:

1. Visit [Paperback Portal](https://portal.paperback.moe).
2. Login with your Paperback Account - or create one if you don't have one.
3. Change the content setting to your liking (**Restricted** - **Mature** - **Adult**).
4. Logout of the app if you were logged in.
5. Log back in again.

::: tip Notes

-   If you set your content settings to "Adult" on the portal, you can restrict what content appears in the app by going into **Settings** > **General** > **Content Filtering**.
-   Setting your content settings to anything lower than "Adult" will prevent you from installing extensions from repositories which contain at least one or "Adult" extension, the same goes for "Mature".

::: details Some common problems

-   **I've updated my settings on the portal, why has it not changed in my app?**
    Simply logout, restart the app by removing it from your app switcher and log back in.

-   **I have selected "Adult" but it is not saving my selection.**
    Clear your safari cache ([Learn more](https://support.apple.com/en-us/105082)) or login to the Portal through an incognito window.

-   **Logging in to the app shows communication/unknown error.**
    Make sure your email is verified (check spam/promotion). Make a support post in the official Discord server if that did not fix it, you can find a guide on how to do that [here](/guides/further-support/#using-the-official-discord-server).
