# Changing Content Settings

Adjusting your content settings to "Mature" or "Adult" is often necessary to add content to your app. Here is how to do it:

1. Visit the [Paperback Portal](https://portal.paperback.moe).
2. Log in with your Paperback Account or create one if you don't have one.
3. Customize the content setting to your preference (**Restricted**, **Mature** or **Adult**).
4. If you were logged in, log out of the app.
5. Log back in again.

::: tip Notes

-   If you set your content settings to "Adult" on the portal, you can control what content appears in the app by navigating to **Settings** > **General** > **Content Filtering**.
-   Setting your content settings to anything lower than "Adult" will prevent you from installing extensions from repositories containing at least one "Adult" extension. The same applies to "Mature".

::: details Frequently Asked Questions

-   **Why hasn't my settings update on the portal reflected in my app?**

    Simply log out, restart the app by removing it from your app switcher, and log back in.

-   **Why isn't my selection of "Adult" saving?**

    Clear your browser cache or log in to the Portal through an incognito window.

-   **Why am I encountering a communication/unknown error when logging into the app?**

    Ensure your email is verified (check spam/promotion). If the issue persists, make a support post in the official Discord server. You can find a guide on how to do that [here](/guides/further-support/#using-the-official-discord-server).

-   **Why is this necessary?**

    Apple requires this for apps that may display incidental mature “NSFW” content ([Learn more](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#user-generated-content)).
