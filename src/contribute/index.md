Welcome to Paperback contributing guide. If Paperback initially is a closed source application, it involves a pretty important open source ecosystem. Everyone is welcome to contribute and help in our various projects!

# Paperback ecosystem

You will find all of our projects in our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS). Additionally, discussions usually take place in the development channels of our Discord server. You're more than welcome to join in on the conversation!

Here are some of our main projects:

-   **Paperback sources**  
    Sources for the application are developed and maintained by the community. These currently consist of sources for pulling content into the app, but in the near future, this will also include tracker implementations.
    Get started with our [source development guide](/contribute/source-development/).

-   **Paperback website**  
    Any help improving this [website](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/website/) is definitely welcome.

-   **Paperback Toolchain/Types**  
    Our CLI tool to bundle extensions repositories and the types for the Paperback API.
