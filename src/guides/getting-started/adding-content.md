# Adding Content

Paperback itself comes without any content. The user needs to add this themselves. While it sounds like a hurdle this can be quite straight forward and be done in less than 10 minutes if you know what to do.

There are 2 methods to add content to the app:

1. [Komga:](https://komga.org) A comic and manga self hosting utility, similar to Plex for movies and series.
2. [Third party sources:](#) Self hosting is not necessary with Paperback, other sources are supported as well.

## Komga

::: warning Warning
Using Komga with Paperback requires you to have a computer or NAS on and running Komga at all times that you want to use Paperback. You also need to get digital versions of your comics or manga on that computer or NAS.
:::

### Komga setup

An extensive guide on how to setup Komga itself can be found on their official website [here](https://komga.org/docs/category/installation).

### Connecting Komga to Paperback

After setting up Komga you need to connect it to Paperback, the official Komga website also has an amazing guide for that [here](https://komga.org/docs/guides/paperback).

## Third party sources

Third Party sources are sources for Paperback not made by the official developers. This means that we do not maintain them nor give support for them. Neither do we allow mentioning them in the [official Discord server](https://discord.paperback.moe) or [GitHub page](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/app).

::: danger Warning
Requests for support related to third party sources in the [official Discord server](https://discord.paperback.moe) or [GitHub page](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/app) will get declined at all times.
