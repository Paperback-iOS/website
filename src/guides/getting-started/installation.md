== Sideloading

Sideloading is an alternative method to install apps, this is done using a sideloading tool on a computer like [Alt Store]() or [Sideloadly]() to load an `.ipa` file onto your Apple device, you can find the latest released `.ipa` file [here](https://github.com/Paperback-iOS/app/releases/latest).

We advice against this method and recommend that you either use the App Store or TestFlight methods.
