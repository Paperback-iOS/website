# Content settings

Adjust your content settings to "Mature" or "Adult" tends to be necessary to be able to add content to your app.

## Set your content settings

1. Visit [Paperback Portal](https://portal.paperback.moe/welcome).
2. Login with your Paperback Account - or create one if you don't have one.
3. Change the content setting to your liking ("Restricted" - "Mature" - "Adult").
4. Logout of the app if you were logged in.
5. Log back in again.

::: tip Notes

-   If you set your content settings to "Adult" on the portal, you can restrict what content appears in the app by going into `Settings > General Settings > Content Filtering`.
-   Setting your content settings to anything lower than "Adult" will prevent you from installing sources from repositories which contain at least one "Mature" or "Adult" extension.
