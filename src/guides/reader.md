# Using the Reader

The reader is what you use to load and view the images of a chapter. Here we will quickly discuss some of its behaviors and features.

## The User Interface (UI)

On starting the reader it will show a UI containing info about the chapter and buttons. The visibility of this UI can be toggled by simply tapping the middle of the screen.

## The Settings

The reader comes with a large amount of settings so you can customize it to your liking and to the type of media that you are reading. Frequently used settings have their own button in the reader UI.

You can open the settings page by pressing the cogwheel at the bottom of the reader.

### Settings Scope

There are two settings scopes, "Global" and "Manga".

:::: tabs
== "Manga" Scope

By default changes to the settings will only apply to the title which you have currently open, this is the "Manga" scope.

== "Global" Scope

The "Global" scope will apply to all titles which don't have manually changed settings, to change this scope you will need to press the "**Apply Globally**" button at the bottom of the settings page after making your changes.
