# Migrating Extensions

Migrating is the process of moving all titles in your library from one extension to others. This may be needed in the case that an extension stops working.

## How to migrate

1.  Go to your Library.
2.  Tap the options button _(triple dot icon)_ in the top right corner and select **Migrate**.
3.  Choose if you want to migrate all titles of an extension or just the ones in certain collections.
4.  Select the extension you want to migrate from.
5.  Select the potential extensions you want to migrate to.
    > It will try to migrate based on the order of the extensions, if one fails it tries the next one.
6.  Choose whether the app should attempt to migrate the chapter markers (chapter progress).
7.  Choose whether the app should include already migrated titles (titles with one of the target extensions already attached).
8.  Select the **Start** button in the top right corner.
9.  It will ask you to make a backup, you should always make a backup of your data when you migrate titles from one extension to others.
10. Check if the migrated titles are correct or if they need manual adjustment
11. Choose the titles that you want to actually migrate by selecting **Replace** or **Merge**.
