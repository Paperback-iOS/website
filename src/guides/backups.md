# Backing up Your Data

You should always have a backup of your library, especially before updating the app, migrating or doing a database repair. This ensures that no data loss is possible.

## Creating a Backup

1. Go to **Settings** > **Backups**.
2. Press "**New Backup**" and choose where you want to save the backup.
   > We recommend that you save it to your Files app.

::: tip Crashing During the Backup Process
If the app crashed when you made the backup that means that your database has been corrupted, go to settings and press and hold "**Attempt Database Repair**".

## Importing a Backup

- Go to your previously saved backup and press the share icon.
- Select the Paperback app.
- Select "**Yes**" on the "Restore Backup" pop-up.
