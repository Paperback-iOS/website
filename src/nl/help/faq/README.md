# Frequently Asked Questions
If you have questions about the app and our plans or need help with installing the app, try checking our guides and faq entries. If you haven't found what you needed, feel free to join the Discord and ask.

## General Information

### Why are you making this app?
There are no decent manga apps on **iOS** that have _non-intrusive_ advertisements or **MangaDex** support.

### What type of business model will you take on?
There are no plans to adopt a formal business model. As long as Patreon covers the costs of an Apple Developer Account, profit is secondary. It would be nice to get support for development of the app, but there will be no charge to use Paperback.

### When are you planning on releasing the app?
There is a public build of the application on [GitHub](https://github.com/FaizanDurrani/Paperback-Public/releases). Acquiring an Apple Developer Account has been difficult, but hopefully TestFlight builds will be able to be launched soon. after getting one and be able to full release Paperback on the App Store. For a guide to install the application see: 

* [Paperback Installation Guide](/help/guides/getting-started)

## Troubleshooting

### The reader is open but stays blank when I try to read a chapter
 * Switch between the horizontal/vertical viewers. If switching doesn't fix, try to read the same chapter on safari, if it works, ping @Paper on Discord in #support channel.
 * Some chapters are taken off of MangaDex due to group conflicts or chapters being scans of the official TL.

---

### A blue X appears sometimes when I try to read a chapter
Scroll/swipe a couple of pages away then come back to the failed page, it should reload. If that doesn't work, close the reader and open the chapter the again.

---

### Pages often fail/take a long time to load
 * If you're in SEA get a VPN (Psiphon or ProtonVPN) MangaDex servers have routing issues in SEA.


 * If you're not in SEA and still face this issue, see if there's any announcements in the MangaDex discord about server complications.

---

### I can't find X manga but it's on MangaDex
 * If the manga is REALLY new (1st chapter added in the last hour) it wont be available until after an hour.
 * If the manga isn't new, chances are it's restricted. At the moment, the app doesn't support reading restricted Manga.
Read on the website instead.

### Syncing lists takes a really long time
Syncing more than 1,000 manga will take some time, however you can improve this improve by changing the list type on Follows page of MD:
 * On Safari, go to [https://mangadex.org/follows/manga/](https://mangadex.org/follows/manga/) and change the display list to "Simple List" from the menu in the top right of the table.

### Sorting by Latest Updates doesn't work
It works but it doesn't respect user's selected language, try to use Update Count sorting instead.

### I have an issue that's not listed here
If its a bug, file a bug report on GitHub for review. Otherwise, ask for help in the Discord #support channel.
