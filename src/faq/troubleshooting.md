# FAQ - Troubleshooting

Commonly encountered questions about resolving app issues.

## I have an issue with one of my third-party extensions

Paperback does not give support for third-party extensions. Please reach out to the extension developer for assistance.

## What app version am I using?

Ensure that you are on the latest build available to you. Paperback is still in Beta and is continuously being updated.

## The app crashes on launch

You may be encountering a known or unknown bugs for your Paperback version. Contact us on our Discord `#support` channel, and staff will try to determine what's happening with you.

## The app crashes in Library and Download Manager

Run a database repair repair, you can find this option in the **Settings** page.

## The app crashes when I attempt database repair

Try making a backup. If the app crashes while making a backup, export your database via **Settings** > **Developer** > **Export Database** and long press the "**Attempt Database Repair**" button and attempt a repair without making a backup.

## The app crashes when I try to log in

This happens on devices running iOS 17.1 or iPad OS 17.1. To fix this you will need to verify the email address of your Paperback account, an email for this was send automatically on account creation (check your spam/promotion folders).

## The thumbnail of a title does not appear

In the library, long press the thumbnail and then select **Refresh Metadata**.

## Titles are not showing up in my library after I added them to it

You need to [adjust your content settings](/getting-started/content-settings) for Adult titles to be shown in the library.

## I found a bug, what should I do?

If reading this page did not allow you to solve it, you can make a bug report, more info on how to do this can be found [here](/getting-started/further-support/#using-the-github-repository).

> Please make sure the bug was not already reported before opening an issue.
